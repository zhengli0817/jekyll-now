title: Web Scraping Indeed for Key Blockchain Engineering Job Skills
---

Blockchain (or crypto in general) has been a rabbit hole for me since 2017, as a geek myself, I am eager to know what are the key job skills to break into blockchain space. 

This is inspired by Jesse Steinweg-Woods's [blog post](https://jessesw.com/Data-Science-Skills/) on data scientist job skills, I would like to do a similar analysis on blockchain engineer job skills.

It is a bit surprising that Java has such a high count as a key word in job descriptions. I never feel a need to learn Java if I want to become a blockchain engineer. Then why?

After digging into some job descriptions, Java is mostly cited as one of mainstream programming language. It is simply put there to say that this job requires that applicants know at least one of the common languages:

> Experience with one or more of these languages: C/C++、Java or Go;

> Strong proficiency in developing objected-oriented software, with deep experience in one or more relevant languages (Java, C, C++, C#)

So, it's all right if you don't know Java!
