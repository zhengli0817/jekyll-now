---

Blockchain (or crypto in general) has been a rabbit hole for me since 2017, as a geek myself, I am eager to know what are the key job skills to break into blockchain space. 

This is inspired by Jesse Steinweg-Woods's [blog post](https://jessesw.com/Data-Science-Skills/) on data scientist job skills, I would like to do a similar analysis on blockchain engineer job skills.
